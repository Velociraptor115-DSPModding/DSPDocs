# DSP Docs

The intent of this repo is to be a place where DSP modders can document their understanding of the game code.

## Rules

* Please do not upload any source assets, although you may make reference to them in your documentation

## Structure

* /Reference

  The reference section should ideally mirror the code namespaces and types closely and provide information specifically about those types

* /Concepts

  The concepts section should be used to document overall concepts involved in either the game or the game's code

  * /Concepts/Game

    Document concepts used in the game and how they relate to the code

  * /Concepts/Code

    Document concepts that only pertain to the code, like overall architecture, general patterns found in the code, etc.
