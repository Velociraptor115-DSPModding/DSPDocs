# Components

The game follows the Entity-Component model. Each building placed is considered as an entity which can have one or more components linked to it. Most of the building functionality is implemented in terms of components

* The [AssemblerComponent](../../References/ROOT/AssemblerComponent.md) does not just cover the Assembler building in-game, but also Smelters, Oil Refineries, Chemical Facilities and Particle Colliders
* The [StationComponent](../../References/ROOT/StationComponent.md) is used by PLS, ILS and Orbital Collectors
* [InserterComponent](../../References/ROOT/InserterComponent.md)
